## Referenced projects and protocols

- TradingAgents: CLI workflow/layout inspiration only; no upstream source is vendored. Source: https://github.com/TauricResearch/TradingAgents

## Domain parameter data

`src/valuationagent/finance/data/industry_parameters_v2.json` is a normalized snapshot attributed in the file to `行业参数数据库_v2_全行业(1).xlsx` and records the supplied source SHA-256. The original workbook is not present in this repository. The snapshot therefore reports partial metadata and does not claim a complete observation period, sample size, owner, update frequency, or confidence interval. The food/beverage and liquor route is an explicit quality-C fallback to an existing generic row, not a claimed industry statistic.
